This repository contains the annotated code I wrote for simulations for my dissertation. Please see my dissertation appendix for more information regarding software and quality control procedures I used.

One important note is that some of the Nof1 code requires the RCTdesign package, which (at this time) is not available on CRAN. Please refer to https://rctdesign.org/ if you wish to have access to that. All other packages (at this time) are maintained on CRAN.
